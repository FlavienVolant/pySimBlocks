# Getting Started with pySimBlocks

pySimBlocks is a block-based simulation framework for control systems, 
supporting both programmatic and graphical modeling workflows.

This guide walks you through the core concepts in a progressive manner.

## 1. First Simulation (Python)

Build and simulate a closed-loop system directly in Python.

You will learn:
- How to create blocks
- How to connect signals
- How to run a discrete-time simulation
- How to log and visualize results

→ [Start Tutorial 1 — Python API](tutorial_1_python.md)

## 2. First Simulation (GUI)

Rebuild the same system using the graphical interface.

You will learn:
- How to create a model visually
- How to configure blocks and simulation settings
- How to save and export the project

→ [Start Tutorial 2 — GUI](tutorial_2_gui.md)
