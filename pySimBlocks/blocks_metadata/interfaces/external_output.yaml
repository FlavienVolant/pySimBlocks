summary: >
  Pass-through block for external real-time commands/values.

description: >
  Pass-through block intended to expose a model command/value to an
  external real-time application (motors, network, hardware driver, etc.).

  This block does not perform any synchronization. It only enforces the
  pySimBlocks signal convention (column vectors of shape (n,1)).

parameters:
  sample_time:
    type: float
    required: false

ports:
  inputs:
    - name: input
      dynamic: false
      pattern: in
      source:
        type: fixed
      shape: [n, 1]
