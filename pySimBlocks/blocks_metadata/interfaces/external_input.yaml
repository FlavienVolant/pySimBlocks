summary: >
  Pass-through block for external real-time measurements.

description: >
  Pass-through block intended to inject measurements coming from an
  external real-time application (camera, robot sensors, network, etc.)
  into a pySimBlocks model.

  This block does not perform any synchronization. It only enforces the
  pySimBlocks signal convention (column vectors of shape (n,1)).
