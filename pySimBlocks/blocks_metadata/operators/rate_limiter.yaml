summary: >
  Discrete-time rate limiter block.

description: >
  Limits the rate of change of the output signal according to:
  $$
  \Delta u = u[k] - y[k-1]
  $$
  $$
  y[k] = y[k-1] + \mathrm{clip}(\Delta u,\; s^{-} dt,\; s^{+} dt)
  $$
  where $s^{+}$ is the rising slope and $s^{-}$ is the falling slope.
