class SofaExchangeIO(Block):
    """
    Interface block for embedding a pySimBlocks model inside a SOFA controller.

    Description:
        This block does NOT run a SOFA simulation. It only exposes:
            - input ports written by an external SOFA controller
            - output ports produced by the pySimBlocks model

        It is fully stateless and acts only as a data bridge.
        Unlike SofaPlant (full SOFA simulation), this block *does not runs* the SOFA simulation itself but should be set in a SOFA controller.

    Parameters:
        name: str
            Block name.
        input_keys: list of str
            Names of externally provided input signals.
        output_keys: list of str
            Names of output signals to be consumed by SOFA.
        controller_file: str
            Path to the controller file. Only for automatic generation.

    Inputs:
        Dynamic — specified by input_keys.

    Outputs:
        Dynamic — specified by output_keys.
