class SofaExchangeIO(Block):
    """
    SOFA exchange interface block.

    Summary:
        Provides an interface between a pySimBlocks model and an external
        SOFA controller by exposing dynamic input and output ports.

    Parameters (overview):
        input_keys : list of str
            Names of externally provided input signals.
        output_keys : list of str
            Names of output signals to be consumed by SOFA.
        scene_file : str
            Path to the SOFA scene file, used only for automatic generation.
        sample_time : float, optional
            Block execution period.

    I/O:
        Inputs:
            Defined dynamically by input_keys.
        Outputs:
            Defined dynamically by output_keys.

    Notes:
        - This block does not run a SOFA simulation.
        - It acts only as a data exchange interface.
        - The block is stateless.
        - Outputs are produced by the pySimBlocks controller logic.
