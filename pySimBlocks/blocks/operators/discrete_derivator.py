class DiscreteDerivator(Block):
    """
    Discrete-time differentiator block.

    Summary:
        Estimates the discrete-time derivative of the input signal using a
        backward finite difference:
            y[k] = (u[k] - u[k-1]) / dt

    Parameters:
        initial_output : scalar or array-like, optional
            Output used at the first execution step.
            If provided, it also FIXES the signal shape permanently.
        sample_time : float, optional
            Block execution period.

    Inputs:
        in : array (m,n)
            Input signal (must be 2D).

    Outputs:
        out : array (m,n)
            Estimated discrete-time derivative.

    Notes:
        - Stateful block.
        - Direct feedthrough.
        - Shape is frozen as soon as known (initial_output or first input).
        - No implicit vector reshape; matrices are supported.
        - Policy:
            - Never propagate None: output is always at least (1,1) zeros.
            - Shape is unresolved while only scalar placeholder (1,1) is seen and no
              explicit initial_output is provided.
            - If initial_output is provided -> shape is frozen immediately (including (1,1)).
            - If no initial_output -> shape is frozen as soon as a non-scalar input arrives.
            - Once shape is frozen -> any non-scalar mismatch raises ValueError.
            - If shape frozen to (m,n) and input is scalar (1,1) -> broadcast scalar to (m,n).
            - When shape is frozen from a first non-scalar input, u_prev is initialized to
              that input to avoid bogus derivative spikes.
