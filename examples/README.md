# Examples

This directory contains a collection of example models demonstrating the capabilities of pySimBlocks.

The examples are organized by complexity and use case.

## Structure

### basics/

Small and focused examples illustrating core features:

- State-space systems
- PID control
- Observers
- File sources
- Algebraic functions
- Simple closed-loop systems

These examples are intended for learning and quick experimentation.

### advanced/

More complex use cases, including:

- SOFA integration (GUI and Python workflows)
- Hardware and real-time execution
- Quadratic programming problems

These examples target advanced users and research-oriented applications.

### comparison/

Examples comparing pySimBlocks with external tools
(e.g. Simulink).

### tutorials/

Code used in the official documentation tutorials.

These files correspond directly to the examples described
in the *Getting Started* guide.

---

Each example can typically be executed either:

- Directly as a Python script  
- Through the GUI-based editor `pysimblocks` (for YAML-based projects)
- Through the generated `run.py` (for GUI-based projects)
